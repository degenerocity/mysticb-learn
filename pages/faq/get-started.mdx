# Getting started with Mystic Boutique

Mystic boutique is a utility based NFT collection that allows holders to nominate an account to receive fully private payments. 
We believe it is our users’ right to be able to keep their finances discreet and private if they so choose. We are pro-decentralized finance and inclusive economies.

## OG Collection

A fresh wallet is a critical part of our process, because the connection between this new receive address and your previous transactions and accounts on the Cardano blockchain will be broken, and that’s how our token utility functions to give you privacy and anonymity. 
Fresh wallet means created with new seed phrase! Utility will be activated in phases (please see the road-map ) determined by liquidity levels on our backend. 
We will keep the community updated on these levels as we continue to build and grow. 
ONLY YOU can see and track your transactions on your dashboard. We couldn’t even see them if we wanted to, which is one of the main reasons we’re able to guarantee that your transactions are 100% private and always will be.

## Questions

1. **Why do I need a new wallet?** A fresh wallet is a critical part of our process, because the connection between this new receive address and your previous transactions and accounts on the Cardano blockchain will be broken, and that’s how our token utility functions to give you privacy and anonymity. Fresh wallet means created with new seed phrase!
1. **Can I send ADA from an exchange?** Yes, however we don't suggest you do this if you don't have to and here is why. a) Not all exchanges use real ADA but rather a type of wrapped Ada. b) Exchanges take a long time to send ADA so you could be waiting 12 hour to mint. c) Exchanges don't all calculate the sending fee separately to your send amount. This means that you will have to calculate the amount you sending with the exact fees deducted from the amount. d) You need a Cardano native wallet to receive your NFT top as NFT cannont be sent to the exchange **TLDR. You can but we don't suggest it.**
1. **What wallet should I use?** We suggest using Nami, Yoroi, Daedalus or ccwallet. 
1. **When will utility be activated?** Utility will be activated in phases (please see the road-map ) determined by liquidity levels on our backend. We will keep the community updated on these levels as we continue to build and grow. 
1. **Can I sell my NFT?** Yes. Our NFTs – and the utility that goes with them – are fully transferrable. As a buyer of an NFT will not be able to currently have the NFT sent to their anonymous destination wallet, they will have to wait for our Phoenix tool before utility is restored.
1. **How private are these transactions if I can see them?** ONLY YOU can see and track your transactions on your dashboard. We couldn’t even see them if we wanted to, which is one of the main reasons we’re able to guarantee that your transactions are 100% private and always will be. 
1. **Why are you breaking up the drop into stages / CAPS?** We’ve chosen to release our NFTs this way to avoid congestion, reward earlier adopters, and to guarantee fair distribution.
1. **How will the drops actually work?** Please see our website [FAQ](/faq/get-started) or come to our discord and check out #how-to-mint for drop details. 
1. **Can I buy more than one NFT?** Yes. You can buy as many as you like. 
1. **Where can I find out more about the project?** See our website and follow us on Twitter 
1. **What happens to any data I submit during mint?** We do not, nor will we ever, store any data related to our community wallets or receive addresses. The information we use to coordinate our NFT drop process will be deleted immediately following completion of the drop. It is critical to our project security that we do not hold any of our users’ information.
1. **What will each Adanon NFT cost?** Our project is a full utility project whereby we don't just want to provide the promise of utility in the future, we want to deliver immediately after mint. For this to happen and for the upper limit per transaction to be practical, we will be channeling the revenue after costs of the 87 ADA mint to Mystic Boutique liquidity. This not only provides better utility (sooner and higher single transactions allowance) but also automatically assigns value benefit to our OG NFT holders with amazing transaction benefits.
1. **Why is the time taken to mint so variable with this process?** To make our mint process anonymous we have a lot working in the background of the mint. The one important mechanism that improves our anonymity is account polling. We have set this polling to every hour. That means that after you send the ADA to start the mint, the actual minting will be somewhere within the hour block before it is initiated. This means that with blockchain congestion (Ada sending) a mint could take anywhere between 2 mins up to 2 hours.  **TLDR: It helps your anonymity to have time variability with minting.**
